# knative-101

A succint guide with chapters showing you how to deploy and manage serverless microservices with Knative. This isn't a definitive guide to introduce you to what serverless or Kubernetes is. Rather, it shows how you can run your own serverless platform on top of Kubernetes, using Knative.

The aim is for developers that belong to a team that provides some core API or platform for other teams to build and run apps/services, or you want to run a serverless platform on your Kubernetes cluster, in order to increase productivity and time-to-market for your product. This guide uses a local Kubernetes cluster for examples but you can do the same on any Kubernetes cluster, on-premise or cloud.

If you want to configure a production Knative installation, please see the [Knative documentation](knative.dev).
